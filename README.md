# Titanic Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates a complete data-cleaning workflow using Python and Pandas.
I cleaned the Titanic dataset by handling missing values, converting data types, 
standardizing categorical variables, detecting outliers, extracting features from text, 
and exporting a final cleaned CSV.

## Cleaning Steps
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized categorical fields (Sex, Embarked)
- Extracted passenger titles from Name
- Imputed missing age values based on passenger class
- Replaced missing cabin values with "Unknown"
- Converted data types to categorical where appropriate
- Detected and handled outliers in Fare and Age
- Exported cleaned dataset

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Google Colab
